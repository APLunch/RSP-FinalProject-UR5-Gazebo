This folder contains all simulations for this project. The simulations world should be as close as possible to the real-world setup, and have exact same control/sensing/comms channels as the real setup.

```gz_ros2_control``` folder contains the source of the ```ign_ros2_control``` package which accompdates ROS2 controller usage in the ignition gazebo simulation environment.

```ur_simulation``` folder contains ```ur_gazebo``` package which is the ignition gazebo simulation set-up package for ur5. A detailed README file is included in this package.
