## Introduction
This package is a [MoveIt!](https://moveit.picknik.ai/humble/index.html) configuration package which is necessary for the motion planning of the robot.

In ROS1, it is ususally generated using *moveit_setup_assistant* from a urdf file, and is used to configure MoveIt functaionalities. However, at current stage, MoveIt has not yet been fully migrated to ROS2 galactic (nor other distributions). 

This package is generated using a work-around method [Build a MoveIt Package for ROS2](https://industrial-training-master.readthedocs.io/en/foxy/_source/session3/ros2/3-Build-a-MoveIt-Package.html).
