# Intelligent General Robot

## Introduction
Welcome to the Intelligent General Robot project, an innovative research initiative aimed at integrating state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and multi-modal AI systems, such as GPT-4, into the control loop of robotic systems. Our goal is to create versatile manipulators and mobile robots capable of understanding and executing tasks described using natural human language. This project encompasses various cutting-edge technologies, including computer vision for object detection, segmentation, and tracking, as well as simulations and ROS2 for seamless integration and communication within the robotic ecosystem. By harnessing the power of LLMs, our Intelligent General Robot project aspires to bridge the gap between human language and robotic capabilities, thereby revolutionizing the way we interact with and utilize robotics in our everyday lives..
